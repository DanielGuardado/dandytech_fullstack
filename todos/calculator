Session Changes
[] The ability to toggle 'cashback purchase'
 - so this is a session option that should trickle into the items to recalculate. by default cashback should be enabled (we could store this default in configs down the road) right now that's the functionality we have it on for everything and these changes are going to be specificaly for regular_cashback. Since some purchases are made via cash payment i don't get those cashback additions. if we started with cashback on and then swith to cashback off all the line items for total_cashback should switch to 0 for that session. if we are in a toggled off state when adding new items they should be added with 0 already. if we switch back to cashback on for the session we should recalcualte all the line items again and any more added from that point on will include the cashback

[] The ability to toggle tax exempt
- this is very similar to cashback in the sense that we may not be tax exempt for some purchases the default should be tax exempt on to begin with and really its going to be the same logic and flow as The ability to toggle 'cashback purchase'

UI Changes
[] Consolidate markup and deductions into 1 column - column something like 'adjustments' then we should have a tooltip when we hover over that'll show the breakdown of markups/deductions

Frontend/Backend integrations
[] Edit on line items
- we should have the ability to click the edit field and make the Variant, qty, market, markup/deductions, all the fields that are auto calculated can be left the same. The part here that will require the most thought will be switching variants but lets map out how that would affect things.


Shipping Cost Feature
[] we have this in the calculation breakdown and it's helpful but i think we should have the ability to assign the shipping cost on the add calculator item instead of just auto assigning from the PurchaseCalculatorConfig we can use those values instead to setup the 'default'

After implementing ^
[] Ability to see the shipping cost on the table and make edits to it.


[] Where is the session name coming from right now? we should be able to set the session name 

[] move the manual button toggle to the top of the form field for easy changing since it'll be a common intereacting

[] add a manual_checkbox_mode dropdown.
default - itll do what it normally does by checking to see if it's manual sensitive or not
no manual - will always tick the checkbox to off
manual - will always tick the checkbox to on
